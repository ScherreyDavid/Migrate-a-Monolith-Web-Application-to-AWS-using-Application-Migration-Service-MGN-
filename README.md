# Migrate a Monolith Web Application to AWS using Application Migration Service (MGN)

I migrated a monolithic web application to AWS using Application Migration Service (MGN). I re-hosted the application server on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and re-platformed the database on Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Finally, I tested the migrated application and verified that it was successfully migrated to AWS.
## Tasks

Task 1: Explore and verify the source web application before migration

Task 2: Re-Host the source application Server (SourceWebApp)

Task 3: Re-Platform the database server

Task 4: Test the migrated application

## Tech Stack
**Web/App Server:** (SourceWebApp) running simple PHP and SQL application

**Database Server:** (SourceDB) running MySQL

**AWS Services:** Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)
